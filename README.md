# Epstein Files Public Document Library

This repository collects and preserves officially released Epstein-related public documents from U.S. federal government sources or clearly official court releases, and publishes a searchable static site.

## Sources
See `docs/SOURCES.md` for the canonical list of official upstream sources.

## Integrity
- Raw files are stored exactly as released under `data/raw/`.
- Derived artifacts (text, index) are stored under `data/derived/`.

## How to run locally

### Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- Optional: `pdftotext` from poppler

### Setup
```bash
make setup
```

### Common commands
- `make ingest` to download/update official releases
- `make extract` to extract text and build the search index
- `make build` to build the static site into `dist/`
- `make test` to run validation checks
- `make check-links` to verify configured source URLs are not stale
- `make dev` to build then serve `dist/` locally

### Ingest caps
You can override download limits per run:
```bash
EPPIE_MAX_DOWNLOADS_PER_SOURCE=30 EPPIE_MAX_BYTES_PER_RUN=250000000 make ingest
```

### DOJ Epstein Library access (cookies)
Some DOJ Epstein Library pages are age-gated. Use the interactive auth helper once to
capture a local cookie jar:
```bash
make auth-doj
```
The first run will download the Playwright Chromium browser if needed.
Cookies are stored locally in `.secrets/justice.gov.cookies.txt` and are not committed.
`make ingest` will automatically use the jar when present (canonical format is the `.txt` Netscape jar).
The auth helper also writes `.secrets/doj.storage-state.json` for Playwright-based discovery.
You can override the jar explicitly:
```bash
EPPIE_COOKIE_JAR=/path/to/cookies.txt make ingest
```

### Derived outputs
`data/derived/` is treated as a build artifact and is generated by `make extract` or `make build`.

### Serve the site
`make dev` builds the site and starts a local static server at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Build pipeline
GitHub Actions runs a scheduled ingestion workflow that downloads new releases (if any), extracts text, rebuilds the site, validates integrity, and commits updates. Pushes to the default branch deploy to GitHub Pages.
