# Changelog

## 1.1.0
- UI overhaul with a clearer layout, improved results cards, mobile filter drawer, loading and empty states, and shareable URL filters.
- Expanded ingestion architecture with official DOJ Epstein Library adapters, deterministic discovery, size caps, and sharded search index output.
- Developer ergonomics updates: `make venv`, `make node`, and `make setup` with venv-first execution.
- CI updates to rely on Makefile targets for setup, test, and build.
