# Eppie Deep Investigation: 97%+ Categorization & OCR

Started: 2026-02-10T15:16:38-05:00
Branch: autonomous/eppie-97-coverage

## Goals
- Categorization coverage: >= 97%
- OCR coverage (meaningful extraction): >= 97%
- Keep GitHub Pages + mobile UI clean

## Baseline (start)
- Categorization: ~80.9% (per prior session)
- OCR: ~89.2% (per prior session)

## Notes
- Prior enhanced Tesseract-based OCR attempts did not move the needle on ~37 docs.
- Prior categorization blocker: ~181 "Utilities — EFTA..." docs lacking markers.
